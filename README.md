# 1-D-advection-diffusion-model
1-D atmospheric advection-diffusion model, moldif.f90
This model was designed to understand the molecular diffusion processes that occurs in the atmosphere. It will be used to calculate the elemental rations and the isotopic ratios for the major atmospheric components and noble gases.
